The goal of this project is to identify the most sandbagged trad climbing areas in the US, as well as potentially perform some other analysis of climbing area data, e.g. what crags have increased the most in popularity over the last 10 years, the most ticked climbs in America, etc. etc.

Most of the action is in avg_dev_analysis.py (though that name is now a bit outdated since there's also a regression analysis in there).
